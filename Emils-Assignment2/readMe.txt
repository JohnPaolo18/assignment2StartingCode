Description:
This is a java implementation of an XML document parser using custom data structures. This project includes implementations of Stack, Queue, ArrayList, and Doubly Linked List ADTs to validate XML document syntax.

Installation Instructions and Usage:
1. **Requirements:**
   - Ensure you have **Java 8 or higher** installed on your machine.
   - Download and extract the project folder (-.zip) to a location of your choice. 

2. **Running the Program:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the extracted project folder.
   - Locate the **Sort.jar** file inside the folder.
   - Normally we can run the jar file if we have an app gui, but in this case, run the cmd in the root folder
   - To run the sorting program, use the following command:
     ```
     java -jar Parser.jar <path-to-xml-file>
	ex. java -jar Parser.jar res/sample1.xml

4. **Output:**
   - The program will display any syntax errors the xml file would have such as:
	-Missing closing tags
	-Mismatched tag pairs

Javadoc:
